# Quantitative Trading Strategy with Backtesting and Risk Management

This project demonstrates the development of a **Quantitative Trading Strategy**, incorporating **Backtesting** and **Risk Management** techniques. The primary goal is to apply systematic trading strategies that leverage statistical and mathematical models, then evaluate their performance through backtesting and risk analysis.

## Project Overview
This project implements and backtests a quantitative trading strategy using historical financial data. The trading signals are generated based on technical indicators, such as moving averages, and the strategy is tested on past price movements to assess its profitability and robustness. Additionally, risk management techniques are applied to manage the potential risks of the strategy.

The core components of the project include:
- **Strategy Development**: Technical indicators are used to generate buy/sell signals.
- **Backtesting**: Evaluates the strategy's performance on historical data.
- **Risk Management**: Implements risk controls such as stop-loss, position sizing, and performance metrics like Sharpe ratio.

## Key Features
- **Technical Indicators**: Utilizes common indicators like moving averages (e.g., SMA, EMA) to identify trade opportunities.
- **Backtesting**: Tests the strategy on historical data to simulate how it would have performed in the past.
- **Risk Management**: Incorporates risk management strategies such as stop-losses, take-profits, and position sizing rules.
- **Performance Metrics**: Computes metrics like the Sharpe ratio to evaluate the strategy's risk-adjusted return.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual analysis through plots of stock price movements, trade signals, and performance.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaryamanz/Quantitative-Trading-Strategy-with-Backtesting-and-Risk-Management.git
   cd Quantitative-Trading-Strategy-with-Backtesting-and-Risk-Management
   ```

2. **Install the necessary libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter and open the notebook to view and run the code.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Quantitative_Trading_Strategy.ipynb
   ```

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `yfinance`
- `backtrader`
- `seaborn`

Install all dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook `Quantitative_Trading_Strategy.ipynb`.
- Follow the step-by-step implementation to understand the strategy development, backtesting, and risk management techniques.
- Modify the parameters (e.g., stock symbols, timeframes, indicators) to test different trading strategies.

## Results
The notebook provides backtest results, including:
- **Total returns**
- **Sharpe ratio**
- **Drawdown analysis**
- **Buy/Sell signal visualizations**
- **Trade summary** with profit and loss details

By following the steps in the notebook, you will be able to evaluate the performance of the trading strategy and visualize its impact on historical data.

## Future Work
Some potential future improvements to this project include:
- Implementing more advanced indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, RSI).
- Incorporating machine learning models to predict stock movements.
- Adding real-time trading functionality using live data.
- Implementing more robust risk management techniques such as value at risk (VaR).
